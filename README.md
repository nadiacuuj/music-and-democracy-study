# Music's influence on a country's democracy level?

## Overview
- Traditional metrics for assessing democracy (such as GDP per capita) may no longer fully capture our evolving, technology-driven world.
- Following from that, this project unseriously explores another perspective: the link between countries' music preferences and democracy level.
- I consider an initial hypothesize that more diverse music tastes is correlated with more diverse ways of thinking, which should reflect in a higher level of democracy.
